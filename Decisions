## Initial LSTM Model
Architecture: LSTM with 128 hidden units, 1 layer, bidirectional=False.
Learning Rate: 0.001
Result: Overfitting observed with validation loss increasing over epochs.

## LSTM with Bidirectional and Increased Layers
Architecture: LSTM with 128 hidden units, 2 layers, bidirectional=True.
Learning Rate: 0.001
Result: Initial epochs showed poor performance; training loss was high, and validation loss decreased but remained high.

## LSTM with Dropout
Architecture: LSTM with 64 hidden units, 2 layers, bidirectional=True, dropout=0.5.
Learning Rate: 0.001
Result: Significant overfitting, with validation loss increasing after initial epochs.
